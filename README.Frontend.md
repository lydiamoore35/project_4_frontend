- set up separate repo for frontend
- create new react app
- set up components
- import all components to app.js
- create a fetch request to allow the front end to consume the created api and pull seed data to the console
- adjust for CORS so that frontend can pull from created backend api
- add all handle functions for full CRUD
- get creative with css
